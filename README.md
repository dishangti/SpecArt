# SpecArt
A tactical game about transaction and speculation.

## Introduction
In this game, players are connected by the central server, and allocated equal money and goods. The same as the continuous auction transaction rules of a stock market or a futures market, you can pend buying and selling orders on the server, and then the server will process the order queue and decide which pair to deal. Noticed that the number of your money and goods have changed, your goal is to gain 60% money of all the players and win the game.
